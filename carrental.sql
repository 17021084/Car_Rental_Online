Headache rack and toolbox included. Clean title.\n\nThe Good: Everything works. Clean interior, no rips (yet). It\'s been a super-reliable work truck for me - Starts every time, Runs great, Drives and Stops straight, Good tires. Aftermarket radio w/ cd and bluetooth (I have the original radio/cd player if you want it). Since I\'ve owned it (the last 10 years and 110K miles), it\'s been well-maintained - regular oil changes, at 200K miles all fluids were changed, trans was serviced, and the serp. belt, spark plugs, and 2 coils were replaced. It averages 16-17 mpg as long as I\'ve owned it. It doesn\'t burn oil, but it will consume about a quart every 5K mile change.\n\nThe Bad: The previous owners were not kind to it - it got hit on the right front side, got the fender replaced but never painted, the bed and rear bumper have their share of dings/dents/scratches. It was repossessed and I bought it from the bank. Then, 6 years ago a deer committed suicide by running into the drivers fender and door, but that was properly repaired. Currently, the front wheel hubs, the knock sensors, and the water pump need replacing - I already have the parts on hand. The ABS and Brake system lights come on about half the time, I\'ve been told the problem is in the ABS motor relays under the cab, which is a common issue with these trucks - I\'ve never had any problems with the brakes functioning.  I have an OBD2 scanner and am happy to scan and show any codes in the truck.\n\nThe Ugly: See the photos of the right front corner and bed sides / rear.\n\nSummary: That\'s all I can think of to write down about it. It\'s been a solid reliable work truck for me, and I figure it\'s got probably another 75-100K miles in it - but I inherited a newer pickup with less miles, so it\'s time for this one to find work elsewhere. I think it\'d make a great work, farm, or first vehicle (scratch it and not worry!)\n\nCall or text me at 325-201 Twenty Thirteen. I\'m asking $2500, and I\'m happy to meet you just about anywhere in the Abilene / Buffalo Gap area and show you the truck, so please don\'t call and ask me \"what my bottom dollar is.\" Trying to deal over the phone without even seeing what you\'re dealing with - that\'s just silly.\n\nAnd No, I don\'t need any help selling it.'),

Built in 1986 only, low production numbers, only built between 1188 and 1225, I see different figures all over the web. Its a Homogloation car built so that Richard Petty could run the cars in NASCAR. If you are familiar with NASCAR, you will know what that term means. These car are considered AERO cars, it has a special front nose and a large rear aero back glass with a special spoiler. Every one of these car were built exactly the same, they came with every option available from Pontiac in 1986. This is an all original unmolested numbers matching car. that shows to have a little over 76,000 miles, I believe that to be the original millage, mostly because the car still has GM marked hoses. The car is powered by the Chevrolet 305 and 200R4 auto trans. I found the car in S. Dakota, the car only has surface rust and no real rot to speak of, I believe the car was stored indoors in the winter time. The car does run and I have driven it on and off a trailer, that being said, the car does need some work to be considered drivable. The door panels are in great shape but the rest of the interior needs recovered. My plan was to do a full restoration of the car and take it to car shows. This car is a G-body, so it shares a lot of parts with other GM G-body cars. I have to many cars, so this one has to go. These don\'t come up for sale very often and is an opportunity to own a rare car for not a lot of money. I\'m asking $6,000.00 OBO. Please call Jack@  show contact inf'),

Source: Edmunds   * The 2014 Sierra\'s innovative powertrains and handsome aesthetics should appeal to longtime GMC fans and tempt buyers new to the brand. In just one of many mine is bigger battles in the half-ton truck market, the 2014 Sierra\'s 12,000-pound max tow rating is expected to be king - at least for now. Source: KBB.com   * The 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 is all new for 2014. It possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. Open the doors and the Sierra\'s interior welcomes you into a calming and comfortable retreat from the busy outside world. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs, which are more convenient to grab. Spoil yourself with the available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims. It lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Base Level Sierra trims on all models come with a powerful 4.3-Liter V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285 horsepower and a 6-speed automatic transmission. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes. Plus, since you have the choice between two to three trims based on the model picked, GMC has a 2014 Sierra 1500 for just about anyone.

Reviews:   * Monumental torque with diesel and automatic powertrain; high-quality interior; Mega Cab\'s roomy rear seat; quiet highway ride. Source: Edmunds   * If you want a heavy-duty truck engineered to give you the power you need and deliver it in a gorgeous package, look no further than the Ram 3500. With its signature rounded curves and huge front grille, this truck is instantly recognizable and respected wherever it goes. All Ram 3500s come standard with a 5.7L HEMI V8 with 38hp, 400 lb-ft of Torque and a 6-Speed Automatic Transmission. Plus, you have the option to choose the available 6.4L HEMI V8 or the 6.7L Turbo Diesel instead. Ram also gives you other transmission choices as well. On all 3500 sizes and trims you have the option to choose a 6-Speed HD Automatic or a 6-Speed Manual with Overdrive. The exception to this is the Laramie Longhorn Edition and Laramie Longhorn Limited Edition Crew Cabs and Mega Cabs, which do not have the manual as an option. Plus, all Ram 3500s give you the option of two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. Standard on all trims are Anti-Lock Brakes and Stability Control. With Pickups, storage space is always handy. Ram has reserved a very special option, the innovative RamBox Cargo Management System, which is included when you purchase either of the Laramie Longhorn Limited Edition Trims. The interior of the 3500 is a beautiful combination of strength and refinement. The environment has a polished feel even on the base trims. The regular cab can seat 3 on a bench, and the 4-door versions can either seat 5 when there are two-bucket seats up front, or 6 people on 2 rows. For those who love technology, the Laramie Longhorn Edition and Laramie Longhorn Limited Edition Trims have a combination of 3 powerful tools: A GPS Navigation System, Rear Park Assist, and a Rear View Camera.

Source: Edmunds   * The 2014 Sierra\'s innovative powertrains and handsome aesthetics should appeal to longtime GMC fans and tempt buyers new to the brand. In just one of many mine is bigger battles in the half-ton truck market, the 2014 Sierra\'s 12,000-pound max tow rating is expected to be king - at least for now. Source: KBB.com   * The 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 is all new for 2014. It possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. Open the doors and the Sierra\'s interior welcomes you into a calming and comfortable retreat from the busy outside world. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs, which are more convenient to grab. Spoil yourself with the available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims. It lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Base Level Sierra trims on all models come with a powerful 4.3-Liter V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285 horsepower and a 6-speed automatic transmission. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes. Plus, since you have the choice between two to three trims based on the model picked, GMC has a 2014 Sierra 1500 for just about anyone.

This pickup will not run or drive until a fuel pump is installed. Passenger side electric window motor/actuator needs to be replaced.

It has a 5.0L (302ci) V8, automatic transmission and custom aluminum alloy wheels. Tires are in good condition. Body is in very good condition and paint is still nice except for clear coat peeling on hood. \n\nThis pickup\'s mileage was mostly from highway travel (as can be seen from the condition of the interior), and that is why truck is still in such good overall condition. \n\nClear Texas title in my name, in hand. Asking $1850 as the pickup sits, and if requested, I can install the fuel pump for an additional $200, including cost of the pump.\n\nPlease contact through CL portal for additional photos and information. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords: Ford, F100, F250, worktruck, half-ton, classic'),

Reviews:   * Monumental torque with diesel and automatic powertrain; high-quality interior; Mega Cab\'s roomy rear seat; quiet highway ride. Source: Edmunds   * If you want a heavy-duty truck engineered to give you the power you need and deliver it in a gorgeous package, look no further than the Ram 3500. With its signature rounded curves and huge front grille, this truck is instantly recognizable and respected wherever it goes. All Ram 3500s come standard with a 5.7L HEMI V8 with 38hp, 400 lb-ft of Torque and a 6-Speed Automatic Transmission. Plus, you have the option to choose the available 6.4L HEMI V8 or the 6.7L Turbo Diesel instead. Ram also gives you other transmission choices as well. On all 3500 sizes and trims you have the option to choose a 6-Speed HD Automatic or a 6-Speed Manual with Overdrive. The exception to this is the Laramie Longhorn Edition and Laramie Longhorn Limited Edition Crew Cabs and Mega Cabs, which do not have the manual as an option. Plus, all Ram 3500s give you the option of two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. Standard on all trims are Anti-Lock Brakes and Stability Control. With Pickups, storage space is always handy. Ram has reserved a very special option, the innovative RamBox Cargo Management System, which is included when you purchase either of the Laramie Longhorn Limited Edition Trims. The interior of the 3500 is a beautiful combination of strength and refinement. The environment has a polished feel even on the base trims. The regular cab can seat 3 on a bench, and the 4-door versions can either seat 5 when there are two-bucket seats up front, or 6 people on 2 rows. For those who love technology, the Laramie Longhorn Edition and Laramie Longhorn Limited Edition Trims have a combination of 3 powerful tools: A GPS Navigation System, Rear Park Assist, and a Rear View Camera.

Have you ever heard of the legendary reliability AK-47 assault rifle? This vehicular awesomeness is basically the automobile analog to the AK-47̢????s inability to fail. It̢????s 20-years-old but it doesn̢????t have the temperament of a 20-year-old human. It̢????s not neurotic, whiney, or unsure of what it wants. It̢????s more of a gruff old man who knows his role and knows his place and doesn̢????t whine and complain about anything; he just does what he needs to do. He ain̢????t pretty and he isn̢????t gonna give you a sensual massage. But let̢????s be honest, you̢????re looking into this car because you can̢????t afford a Ferrari and you don̢????t want to have to deal with all the stupid problems that come from a lesser, better-looking car. This baby is meant to go from A to B as quickly and reliably as possible and that̢????s it. Or you could rip out its invincible engine and put it in an ultra 4 truck or some other racing vehicle and absolutely smoke the competition. Now let̢????s talk about the sweeter-than-honey things about this car and the not-so-sweeter-than-honey things about this car.\n\nSweeter-than-honey:\nAs mentioned before, it̢????s an AK-47 and more reliable than 98% of the other garbage on here.\nIt̢????s got a sweet 6-cylinder engine that goes 0-60 so quick that any cops that catch you won̢????t know whether to write you a ticket or congratulate this ugly son-of-a-gun for being so fast. They̢????ll probably write you a ticket anyway, but hey that̢????s the risk you take when driving this beast.\nIt̢????s got an A/C that̢????ll have you shivering in 110???? Texas heat in no time. (This is sweeter-than-honey because of a not-so-sweeter-than-honey feature but we̢????ll get there).\nIt has front-wheel-drive which means you can go drifting over those 4 hours of ice we might get every other winter.\nIt̢????s got a new serpentine belt which means you can run this bad boy̢????s engine for years without a second thought.\nIt̢????s got a sweet exhaust system that will make a wolverine purr.\nInstead of a lousy donut its spare tire is an actual tire because you don̢????t want to get in the way of driving like a bat outta hell even if you absolutely destroy 1 of your tires.\n\nNot-so-sweeter-than-honey:\nIt̢????s got a couple brake lines that are rusted underneath the driver̢????s seat (pictures in the post) so you̢????ll need to replace those unless you like taking your life into your own hands on a daily basis. I don̢????t judge but you̢????re not doing that until I have cash in my hands and you have the title in yours.\nThe front passenger̢????s side shock is blown so unless you can counter the shaking of the wheel above 55 mph with shakes of your own equivalent to late-stage Parkinson̢????s, you̢????ll need to replace the shocks.\nIt̢????s a black car with a black leather interior with neither windows working. The driver̢????s side can definitely be repaired with new lining and new motor but the passenger̢????s side is FUBAR. It just so happens that when you play rough with the inside of the door trying to put the nicest 2x4 you̢????ve ever seen in there to hold up the window, you might bend or break a few things.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a sweet and reliable car. If you̢????re of the low-IQ persuasion, pass this bad boy up and go for some newer, less reliable, but prettier car. However, if you̢????re into a car that you know your idiot kid won̢????t destroy or you need it to discretely and unimpressively get to work, this absolute monster is for you. You can reach me via text on my cell or shoot me an email. My cell is probably the better call because I rarely check my email unless it̢????s one of my professors telling me how badly I̢????m screwing up.\n\nI will ONLY accept cash at the time of sale. I will NOT accept checks, money orders, or direct transfers between bank accounts. The sale will be conducted at a police station or another public location.'),

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			\n						\n			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don\'t still have this vehicle, do you?			\n						\n			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we\'ll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			\n						\n			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			\n						\n			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			\n						\n			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			\n						\n			Many customers actually take delivery 			\n			without a checkbook or credit card.			\n			 While this isn\'t a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			\n						\n			 Do you take trade-ins?			\n						\n			Yes.			\n			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn\'t necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We\'d love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			\n						\n			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it\'s worth.			\n						\n			This is another very common situation that usually 			\n			 won\'t 			\n			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			\n						\n			 Are you guys really 1price? Won\'t you negotiate?			\n						\n			We\'ve found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don\'t tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that\'s actually what you want, you may need help.			\n						\n			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			\n						\n			So, I like this vehicle I\'m looking at, but I\'d rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			\n						\n			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.			\n						\n			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			\n						\n			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			\n						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			\n						\n			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don\'t still have this vehicle, do you?			\n						\n			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we\'ll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			\n						\n			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			\n						\n			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			\n						\n			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			\n						\n			Many customers actually take delivery 			\n			without a checkbook or credit card.			\n			 While this isn\'t a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			\n						\n			 Do you take trade-ins?			\n						\n			Yes.			\n			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn\'t necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We\'d love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			\n						\n			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it\'s worth.			\n						\n			This is another very common situation that usually 			\n			 won\'t 			\n			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			\n						\n			 Are you guys really 1price? Won\'t you negotiate?			\n						\n			We\'ve found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don\'t tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that\'s actually what you want, you may need help.			\n						\n			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			\n						\n			So, I like this vehicle I\'m looking at, but I\'d rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			\n						\n			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.			\n						\n			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			\n						\n			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			\n						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			\n						\n			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don\'t still have this vehicle, do you?			\n						\n			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we\'ll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			\n						\n			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			\n						\n			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			\n						\n			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			\n						\n			Many customers actually take delivery 			\n			without a checkbook or credit card.			\n			 While this isn\'t a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			\n						\n			 Do you take trade-ins?			\n						\n			Yes.			\n			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn\'t necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We\'d love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			\n						\n			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it\'s worth.			\n						\n			This is another very common situation that usually 			\n			 won\'t 			\n			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			\n						\n			 Are you guys really 1price? Won\'t you negotiate?			\n						\n			We\'ve found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don\'t tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that\'s actually what you want, you may need help.			\n						\n			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			\n						\n			So, I like this vehicle I\'m looking at, but I\'d rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			\n						\n			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.			\n						\n			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			\n						\n			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			\n						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.
